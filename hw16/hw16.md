RFC 3749 does not include clear text passwords as one of the EAP authentication methods.

Quote "This specification does not define a mechanism for cleartext password authentication. The omission is intentional. Use of cleartext passwords would allow the password to be captured by an attacker with access to a link over which EAP packets are transmitted."
