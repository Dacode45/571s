1. A new value for k should be generated because the private key can be
calculated if s is 0.
s = k<sup>-1</sup>(H(M)+**x***r) mod q
0 = k<sup>-1</sup>(H(M)+**x***r) mod q
This means k<sup>-1</sup>(H(M)+**x***r) is divisible by q.
By trial and error we can figure out **k** and then **x**.

2. No. Once k is known, it is easy to calculate x.
s = k<sup>-1</sup>(H(M)+**x***r) mod q
s = (k<sup>-1</sup>(H(M)) mod q) + (k<sup>-1</sup> * **x** * r mod q) mod q
The only unknown is is x which is trivial to find.
